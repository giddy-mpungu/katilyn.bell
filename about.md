Hi — I'm **Katilyn Bell**, staff with The Navigators at Houston Christian University. I disciple student leaders, plan NavNight (weekly large group), lead retreats, and mentor students one-on-one.  

My passion: help students *get to know Christ, make Him known, and equip others to do the same* (Matthew 28:18–20).
