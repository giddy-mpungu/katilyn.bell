Hello friends! 💖  

As many of you know, I serve with **The Navigators** at **Houston Christian University**.  
My passion is to disciple students, help them grow in Christ, and see them multiply their faith among their peers.

## Why I Fundraise
As Navigators staff, I am responsible for raising **100% of my ministry support**.  
Your partnership makes it possible for me to:  
- Disciple student leaders one-on-one  
- Lead weekly NavNight gatherings and small group Bible studies  
- Organize retreats, extended prayer mornings, and outreach events  
- Share the hope of Christ with students on campus

## How You Can Partner
🙏 **Pray** – for boldness, wisdom, and open hearts among students.  
🌷 **Give** – financial gifts make this ministry possible.
